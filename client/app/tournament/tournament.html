    <h2 class="text-center">The Open Angel Arena team is proud to announce the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament, a custom game tournament
      with a $10,000+ Prize Pool.</h2>
    <p>Yes, you read that right. Last weekend we had a fundraiser for our tournament and we were hoping to raise $500.
      <b>We ended up with $10,349! 100% of that money is going towards the tournaments prize pool.</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The tournament will take place on the 3rd and 4th of March, starting at 3pm Berlin Time both days.</li>
      <li>We currently plan on hosting the tournament for 32 teams. Should enough teams sign up then we might expand the tournament
        to a 64 team bracket.</li>

    <p>Join the
      <a href="https://discord.gg/9ApbMyW">Community Discord</a> to find a team for the tournament and to play games with the best players!</p>
    <h3>Where do I watch?</h3>
    <p>The tournament will be streamed on
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/l34Um1">Baumi's twitch channel</a> but we'll make another announcement the day of the tournament.</p>
    <p>We are also happy to have other streamers cast tournament matches or have players stream their games. Feel free to contact
      us if we can be of assistance.</p>

    <h3>What's happening until then?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>We are still working on the game and a few small features will be added before the tournament. The balance of the game
        will also be adjusted mildly. But these changes will be made a reasonable time ahead of the tournament so you have
        at least a few weeks to practice.</li>
      <li>We will soon release our
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19A8S42MtunAp7q9YHn7u3drwlc26rzyDO6iRoI0p5YY/">first custom hero</a>. This hero will not be allowed in the tournament, so don't worry about that. But if you feel
        like giving some feedback on the guy that would be great and very helpful.</li>
      <li>In all likelihood we are going to be hosting a second fundraiser soon. This time not all money will go to the prize
        pool but instead we want to use some of the donations to help push the development of the game by using it for bug
        bounties and administrative fees like running the website. Donations from this second fundraiser will receive ingame
        rewards through our upcoming free Bottlepass. The fundraiser will be held on my
        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/l34Um1">twitch channel</a>.</li>
      <li>We have our version of a Battlepass, the Bottlepass, releasing soon. This will include MMR and unlockable cosmetics,
        some custom made.</li>
    </ul>
