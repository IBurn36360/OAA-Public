    <p>Open Angel Arena is a modern reimagining of the classic Angel Arena game mode. It was made by a group of passionate Angel
      Arena players that grew unhappy with the current iterations on the workshop. So we took it into our own hands to remake
      the game from scratch, revisiting old features while modernizing and streamlining the gameplay. It is a highly competitive
      game and there is a lot to learn. If you plan on joining the tournament I recommend you start practicing soon.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Most heroes are viable</strong>, including supports, casters and tanks. In fact, supports are absolutely essential
        to many strategies.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>All items are upgradeable</strong>. This allows for a wide range of possible item builds and for an even wider range
        of possible strategies. Have you ever wanted to play attack damage Elder Titan using the 100% lifesteal talent or
        use Lunas ultimate to rain death and stuns on an entire team? In Open Angel Arena these strategies are not only possible
        but actually viable. </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New custom items</strong>, designed by the community and carefully balanced before being added.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bosses have been redesigned to be an integral part of the game and have been made more interesting</strong>. To upgrade
        items you have to kill bosses, often as early as 10 minutes into the game and then regularly for the rest of the
        match. A killed boss respawns as a new, stronger boss with new abilities. Bosses in OAA have various mechanics that
        you will have to deal with while battling them and aren’t simple DPS tanks.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Duels have been redesigned to include objectives that encourage players to fight and enable objective based gameplay</strong>.
        There are multiple different duel arenas that you can be placed into and you will always be playing in a duel. If
        there is a 1v1 in one arena there is also a 4v4 in a different one and so on.</li>
      <li>To win the game you must win a Final Duel.
        <strong>The first team to 100 points will trigger a Final Duel. The team with 100 points then needs to win this Final Duel
          to win the game</strong>. If they don’t then the games score limit gets extended by 10, putting it into overtime.
        This goes on until a team wins a Final Duel.</li>
      <li>Fountain camping has been eliminated from the game.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-238514931">Our custom music is amazing!</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Open Angel Arena is an open source project. There's lots of cool stuff we have designed, if you'd like to help create
      them, check out
      <a href="https://github.com/OpenAngelArena/oaa">our GitHub</a>. We are always looking for new people to help with the game. It’s a fun experience and if you are a
      new developer the best experience you can get is to simply work on a game. If you work on Open Angel Arena you can
      also get feedback on your work by professional developers. You can find the developer discord in the installation instructions
      on GitHub.</p>

    <p>We look forward to having you play in the Open Angel Arena Anniversary Tournament and even if you don't play we hope
      you enjoy watching it!</p>

    <h3>What's happening until then?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>We are still working on the game and a few small features will be added before the tournament. The balance of the game
        will also be adjusted mildly. But these changes will be made a reasonable time ahead of the tournament so you have
        at least a few weeks to practice.</li>
      <li>We will soon release our
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19A8S42MtunAp7q9YHn7u3drwlc26rzyDO6iRoI0p5YY/">first custom hero</a>. This hero will not be allowed in the tournament, so don't worry about that. But if you feel
        like giving some feedback on the guy that would be great and very helpful.</li>
      <li>In all likelihood we are going to be hosting a second fundraiser soon. This time not all money will go to the prize
        pool but instead we want to use some of the donations to help push the development of the game by using it for bug
        bounties and administrative fees like running the website. Donations from this second fundraiser will receive ingame
        rewards through our upcoming free Bottlepass. The fundraiser will be held on my
        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/l34Um1">twitch channel</a>.</li>
      <li>We have our version of a Battlepass, the Bottlepass, releasing soon. This will include MMR and unlockable cosmetics,
        some custom made.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-center">We hope you'll give our game a shot. Lots of great and passionate people have worked hard to make it a truly fun and
      competitive experience!</h3>
